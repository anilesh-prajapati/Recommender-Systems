# Movie Recommender System

This repository contains a project for building a movie recommender system using Boltzmann Machines with Python, PyTorch, NumPy, and Pandas.

## Overview

The objective of this project is to create a recommender system that predicts whether a user will like a movie. The model uses Boltzmann Machines, a type of stochastic neural network, to learn user preferences and make recommendations.

## Features

- **Boltzmann Machines**: Utilizes Boltzmann Machines for recommendation.
- **PyTorch**: Leverages PyTorch for model development and training.
- **Data Handling**: Uses NumPy and Pandas for efficient data manipulation.
- **User Preferences**: Predicts user preferences for movies, indicating like or dislike.
